# Here be dragons!

# supports functions:
# diff-anywhere
# diff-atcursor
# diff-selection
# infill
# edit-chain

# doesn't support:
# highlight

# Improvements over the previous diff:
# 1. Given code (optional cursor position) -> predict user instruction
# 2. Multi turn chat over the same changes
# 3. Tool support (run, goto definition, project search)
# 4. One special token (escape), no position tokens
# 5. Logit intrusion less needed
